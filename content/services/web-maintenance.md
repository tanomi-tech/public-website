Web maintenance is an important aspect of any organization's online presence. Regular updates and upkeep of a website ensure that it remains functional, secure, and user-friendly.

General maintenance is essential for preserving customer trust and ensuring that your website continues to serve as an effective tool for achieving your organization's goals.

Our web support services can provide the expertise and resources necessary to keep your web applications running smoothly and ensure that they continue to provide a positive user experience. By partnering with us, youâ€™re ensured that your web properties remain effective and reliable tools for achieving your business goals.

One common confusion when it comes to web maintenance is the difference between websites and web applications. A website is a collection of web pages that are typically static and provide information to users, such as a company's contact information or a product catalog. 

A web application, on the other hand, is a dynamic and interactive application that runs on a web server and provides users with the ability to perform specific tasks or access information. Examples of web applications include online shopping, social media platforms, and email services.
